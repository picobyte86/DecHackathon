What Are Stop Words?
--------------------
[Stop words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_words) are words in a given language that should be omitted or ignored during natural language processing due to their commonality (this is especially important when using algorithms such as keyword extraction of [tf-idf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf)). For English, common stop words are words such as "a", "of", "the", "under", etc.
